# Code Quiz Challange

## Description
In this project I made a timed quiz on JavaScript basics. The quiz is 5 questions long with each question having 4 multiple choice answers. Users have 60 seconds to complete the quiz and get penalized 10 seconds for every wrong answer choice. After users complete the quiz they can submit their score to Highscore Leaderboard.
